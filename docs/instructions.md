# User Guide
This document assumes that your app is up and running and you're ready to use it. If not, you can find setup instructions in the aptly named setup_instructions.md.

## Post A Message
The main view of the application is the message form, and it is the first view you are greeted with. To post a message to Terry you're required to fill out the form. Once the form has been filled in hit the submit button!
Now, if Google doesn't think that you're a spam bot, and all of your information is valid you should see a big blue message reading "Your message has been submitted." that means your message has been submitted!

## Admin
The client requested an admin view so they could see all of their messages without having to download the plain text files. This view displays a table of all messages found on the server, dislpayed newest to oldest. Once a message has been read and acknowledged you can delete the message from the server and it will be removed from the table.
