# Design Explanation
Although this is just a technical exercise and the delivery is a MVP, I wanted to show how I would go about building a future proofed application. I try thinking of elements that are not required for an initial release but would make sense at a later date, and implementing them in a minimal way.

For future development and potential productisation of the application I would reccomened implementing a Node friendly NoSQL database such as Mongo DB.

The next immediate step in the development of this application would be to add authentication to the admin view. The implementation of this security feature would also work in hand with the addition of a database.

## Side Note
If I had another couple of hours spare I would've wanted to experiment in creating my own JSON  database stored as a file on the server. This is something I have never thought about developing before but the idea of it has me intrigued.
